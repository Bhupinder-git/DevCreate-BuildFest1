### **Authentication System**

- **Demo Credentials**: For testing purposes, the application supports both patient and doctor registration
- **Local Storage**: User sessions are managed client-side using localStorage
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard and certain features require authentication

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fully responsive but some complex features work best on desktop
4. **API Dependencies**: Some features depend on backend API availability

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Image Optimization**: All images are optimized and lazy-loaded
- **Code Splitting**: Components are efficiently bundled for optimal loading
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Lenis library provides enhanced scrolling experience
- **Build Size**: Production bundle is optimized and compressed

### **Deployment Configuration**

- **GitHub Pages**: Configured with custom base path `/BharartCurePlus/`
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment on every push to main branch
- **Asset Handling**: All static assets are properly referenced for production

1. **Images not loading**: Ensure all image imports use proper relative paths
2. **Build failures**: Check Node.js version (requires v18+)
3. **Routing issues**: Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. **Styling problems**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### **Development Tips**
